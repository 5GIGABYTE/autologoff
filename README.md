# autologoff
This automatic log off will use a VBS script on your computer and you can log off of your computer in 5 clicks. I know this may not be useful but it works for some people that need it!

# What is it?

Auto Log Off is made with VB Script and took some effort learning how to code in that language. I use to code in JavaScript, which I was used to.

# How does it work?

Just a few clicks to shutdown. It could be useful for people with slow computers or something.

In a new update, there is just going to be a dialog box saying "Press OK on the next screen to shutoff." then the credits. After the credits there will be a shutdown.

I am working on a lock script. It may be out soon!
